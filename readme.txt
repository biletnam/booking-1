        Booking — Site de réservation en ligne

The project is provided with a 'dockerfile' which
can be used with the docker™ application to easily
build and run in a ready-to-use environment.

The script start.sh has been written to ease the
frustation of typing long cli commands.

Usage: ./start [-i --install] [-r --remove]
    Run the booking image by default

Build with PHP 7.0 and MySQL 5.7
